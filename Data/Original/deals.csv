Public meetings where landowners were encouraged to hand over their land to GVL were watched over by powerful local officials, and in at least one case armed police. Global Witness also documents several accounts of violent assaults and arbitrary arrests of those who voiced their concerns. The MOU was not read to the communities. In October 2015, the Butaw Welfare and Development Association (BWDA) of Butaw District, Sinoe County has officially withdrawn the letter of complaint that was lodged against Golden Veroleum Liberia Incorporated in 2012 which resulted into imposing sanctions on GVL operations in Butaw District since 2012.

Representatives from communities visited the ABN AMRO and Rabobank, both in the Netherlands, in October 2019 to request the bank takes action against the investor. The community is supported by Milieudefensie, Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) and WALHI. In February 2019, the bank announced that communities could come and report on rights violations by its clients who should provide remedy, but now state that they only have an indirect link to the deals and there is little they can do.
In 2021, an investigation (the first of its kind) by the High Carbon Stock Approach was done and found that Golden Veroleum cleared more than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of carbon-rich forests in Liberia’s remote southeast. They recommended that Golden Veroleum freeze any further development of plantation land and work with communities in its concession zone to resolve outstanding disputes and carry out a detailed assessment of the forests there.
In October 2012, Liberian NGO Green Advocates  filed a complaint against the company with the RSPO. 
The NGO Forest People’s Programme has gathered evidence on places where crops were destroyed, shrines were desecrated, villages displaced, and burial grounds and graves sites denigrated, as well as several sites where wetlands, including rivers, marshlands, swamps, streams and creeks, have been dammed or diverted and polluted.

Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) and Milieudefensie, a Dutch NGO, have accused the oil palm company Golden Veroleum Liberia (GVL) of not living up the full commitment of the memorandum of understanding it signed with communities in within its concession areas.At a press conference on Thursday, August 12, both organizations called upon the Government of Liberia to ensure agribusiness in Liberia halts deforestation and rights violations.This was after they have conducted community exercises earlier this year to assess GVL’s compliance with specific obligations and commitments on a healthy environment, jobs, education, health care, development funds and the possibility to start community farms. The research indicates that half of the commitments are not met by GVL and another 20 percent only partially.

Once the banks are able to get back money invested into the partnership, the farmers can largely own their farms.

2005 to enable start-up operations.

Only 19% of the loan was repaid with both the white farmers and the state government defaulting on their loan obligations to the NACRDB.

After investing over $25 million in the unfinished project, KOTACO was liquidated in 1993, leaving the farm and its equipment with RUBADA.  In 1999, the Mngeta farm was contracted to Kilombero Holding Company (KIHOCO). KIHOCO was never able to commence production on more than 400 ha, and after falling five years behind in rent payments, it was forced off the farm.

Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP stated: compensation payments for the loss of crops and fences; construction of new settlement areas and houses; and the provision of
alternative farming plots. The resettlement and compensation process undertaken has been widely commended and the company is often regarded as a role model for agricultural investors. However, reports suggest that the compensation program is fraught with contention. The development of the project has had an inflationary effect on the local land market, which makes it highly difficult for locals to rent agricultural land today. As part of the resettlement plan for the 80 households, which lost both houses and farming land, KPL indicated that it would construct new residential houses and auxiliaries at new settlement sites. One critical issue is the location of the area, which was excised by KPL for the resettlement.","Villagers could either get new land (three acres only regardless of how much land they had before), cash compensation at market value or could secure land themselves and get paid TZS30000 per acre (this amount is below market value).

for residence. With two small rooms (approximately 3.5m x 3.5m) separated by a narrow hall, the houses do not live up to the expectations created by KPL, and more importantly,

However, long before the privatization, villagers had already moved in the then unutilised estate since in the early 1990s when Nafco was slowly dying; they settled in the area. State managers decided to rent out the farmland and machinery to private farmers, to use the rent income to keep the infrastructure up and running and to pay the staff. From 1997 to 2005, the NAFCO management stopped having any role in production and limited itself to repairing and managing the irrigation infrastructure, managing the farm as a paternalistic landlord. Since
1997, tenant farmers started running the estate by renting six-hectare plots. The organisation
of production changed dramatically, as rice farming on the estate was demechanised, by
employing wage workers in place of agricultural machinery. This caused a rapid, significant
increase of wage labor, and migrant workers flocked to the area. In 2004, the government announced the imminent privatisation of NAFCO-Kapunga.

""They approved the loans despite NGO reports and statements from community leaders in all three plantation areas who had drawn their attention to the illegitimate and possibly illegal nature of the concession contracts as well as the appalling working conditions for labourers on the plantations and the many broken promises to communities affected by the plantation concessions.""  A complaint was submitted through the DEG complaints mechanism. On January 7th, 2018 it determined that the complaint was admissible under the criteria of the Independent Complaints Mechanism Policy, and the case is under review.

In June 2019 Golden Oil Holdings Limited (""GOHL""), a wholly owned Mauritius special purpose vehicle subsidiary of African Agriculture Fund L.L.C. (""AAF”) announces that it has acquired common shares representing approximately 13.55%. 

In May 2020, Feronia announes that they are looking to restrucutre the investors/ shareholdering structure in this deal or alterantively sell the operating company to an affiliate of KKM. However, they also clearly state that this is not a final decision and the plans may still change. 

""A critical juncture was reached when Feronia filed for bank-ruptcy in August of 2020. Instead of exploring ways to grant the communities their long held request for the return of the land,  development  banks  handed  over  the  assets  that  Fero-nia held in PHC to Straight KKM, a Mauritius-based private equity  fund,  for  a  cash  payment  of  US$500,000,  an  assump-tion  of  a  portion  of  the  company’s  debt  to  the  development  banks,  and  a  commitment  to  invest  US$10  million  into  the  company. Through the sale, the development banks involved – UK’s CDC Group, Germany’s DEG, the Dutch FMO, Belgian BIO, and the Emerging Africa Investment Fund (EAIF) agreed to write off large portions of their previous loans to the com-pany. However, these banks remain involved in the project as lenders. Straight KKM is owned by various funds affiliated with Kura-mo Capital Management, which claims to be Africa’s “leading independent investment management firm.” Several institu-tional players are major investors in Kuramo funds, including: The  University  of  Michigan  Endowment,  the  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates Foundation Trust, the South African Government Em-ployees  Pension  Fund  and  Public  Investment  Corporation,  the  Royal  County  of  Berkshire  Pension  Scheme,  among  others."" (Oakland Institute, 2021).
In April 2021,  African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), an environmental watchdog, said the South African government’s involvement in PHC was highly inappropriate: “The bottom line here is that GEPF has invested the money of South African workers to entrench dispossession of peoples’ territories and colonial patterns of land ownership and power in the DRC,” said ACB’s executive director Mariam Mayet.

Moreover.Kuramo Capital Management( KCM ) is involved  in a legal battle over ownership of PHC Oil palm plantations in the DRC.A legal battle has erupted over the ownership of the Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), an oil palm firm, which controls over 100,000 hectares of land in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).After acquiring majority ownership in the PHC plantations from European development banks in 2020, former partners have turned on each other with legal action underway across four jurisdictions for control of the company, valued at US$100 million
Evlin Kuyek, researcher at GRAIN mentioned that Before KCM assumed control over the plantations, several European development banks held the majority of shares in PHC through Feronia and invested over US$150 million in the company from 2013 to 2020. When Feronia filed for bankruptcy in 2020, the development banks agreed to pass the assets they held in PHC to a private equity fund controlled by the KCM for a cash payment of US$500,000 and agreed to write off large portions of their remaining debt. The deal was conditional on the new owners investing US$10 million in PHC and implementing a revised environmental and social action plan.",36439,Plantations Et Huileries du Congo sa (PHC),"Congo, Dem.

The land was acquired from the paramount chief of Agogo, Nana Akuoku Sarpong- the land was acquired through the Agogo 
Traditional Council (ATC).

“The farmers were misinformed at the beginning of the project,” Osei-Bonsu said. According to him, the farmers were told they were going to be engaged as outgrowers for Scanfuel but were not told they were going to lose their lands, but as it turned out, their arable lands have been taken away from them.

In Sierra Leona for RSPO certification, Malen Radio broadcasted information about the audit two weeks before the audit in September 2020. One community leader stated he was informed by a company liaison officer who visited the communities 5 days in advance. Some civil society groups said they received notice 3 to 5 days in advance, while others were not notified at all. Civil society organisations from Pujehun district said they did not receive a formal invitation or agenda, which made it difficult to prepare. A second audit took place in early November 2020, according to SCS,2 because they were unable to process all stakeholder comments from the first audit or meet with newly identified stakeholders. SCS did not reach out proactively to international and national civil society organisations to prepare and inform the audits, despite publicly available reports, media statements and other communication about SAC and Socfin as well as news items on Socfin and Bolloré SLAPP suits against those organisations and individuals. Even though their internal communication shows that SCS was well aware of the controversial nature of the company and the high credibility risk.
An important stakeholder group called the Malen Affected Land Owners and Land Users Association (MALOA) stated they were not properly consulted.Although several leaders met informally with one of the auditors, their proposal for a proper consultation meeting with MALOA members was not agreed to by the auditors, reportedly because of security concerns. One company representative confirmed to the researcher that SCS had to return for a second field audit because several stakeholders were not consulted, including MALOA. However, even during that second visit, the auditors failed to consult MALOA. MALOA leaders also stated that the list of stakeholders the company provided to the auditors was heavily biased towards its proponents.",Rejection,"according to Green Scenery, corruption and pressure was applied on land-owners and town chiefs to sign agreements.the establishment of the company has met with significant resistance from the local population. People from several communities affected by the SAC lease area have formed the Malen Affected Landowners Association (MALOA) to defend the rights of landowners and land users. Several individual landowners have also sent official complaints about tree-crop and oil palm plantations that SAC destroyed, allegedly without their permission, to the senior district officer and other local authorities.There have been several confrontations in the area between SAC surveyors and heavy equipment operators and local people protesting SAC intrusion on their lands, some of which have led to arrests. In December 2012, more than 100 aggrieved landowners and users met in Pujehun and signed a resolution calling for the Human Rights Commission to intervene on their behalf and saying they would no longer permit Socfin personnel or machines on their land. On 9th December 2013, another protest was held by the elders to allow people to again express their grievances to the Paramount Chief over the lease of land. Hundreds were waiting in the village of Libby Malen for the chiefdom authorities to arrive when they learned that nine of their fellow villagers had been beaten and arrested by the police en route to the meeting.The rest of the villages fled from the protest spot immediately but were confronted with an armed contingent of police who fired tear gas and live bullets into the crowd, leaving many people with serious injuries.

MALOA members and leaders stated they have not been properly consulted. Therefore, it is likely that the
auditors did not take into account their evidence on land disputes. Their grievances include: landowners were sidelined
during lease agreement negotiations, FPIC was not respected, physical land demarcation disappeared, some
families have lost all their land, lands were taken without due compensation, right to food is undermined, the

According to The ex-president Ernest Bai Koroma of the last All People’s Congress (APC) the first protest against the land grabbing by Socfin in 2011 was violently repressed, forty people were arrested by the police and fifteen were pursued in court. In 2012, fourothers were arrested because they opposed the survey team of Socfin. In 2013, another fifteen people were arrested and detained. In 2014, six leaders of MALOA were arbitrarily arrested and pursued in court. Following a partial trial, they were in prison for several months; in 2015 another eleven people were arrested. In 2019, the tensions led to a conflict on the plantation that left two people dead and eighteen MALOA activists arrested,sometimes beaten and arbitrarily detained for several weeks. I was sued for defamation by Socfin for my
evidence-based statements or writings.”

ES","The General Manager of Socfin, Gerben Haringsma assured the Government of Sierra Leone and the people of Malen Chiefdom that the Company would live up to their corporate social responsibilities including the construction of a resident hospital, network of roads, schools, housing facilities, job opportunities for 10,000 people with special preference given to natives of the chiefdom. Moreover he promised that full payment would be made for existing plantations in the areas of operations to be followed by an annual payment of lease rents to land owners. According to Green Scenery, it is not clear what formula will be used in the distribution of the land lease payment between District Council, administration, national government and land-owners. Socfin originally offered US$220 per hectare as a one-off payment for the land, but this offer was rejected for being very low compared to the real value. Apparently the communities were paid a $40 000 for rent in 2011. The NGO Maloa protests since 2011 against the conditions under which an affiliate of the group settled on his land. Five of its members were jailed for two weeks and will be judged on November 15 2013 for destroying plants palm oil. Socfin now pays $12.50 per hectare per year to community members (2017).

On 4 February 2016, following a lengthy legal process, all six of the MALOA executive members were convicted and ordered to pay heavy fines or face six months imprisonment. In 2017, MALOA and Green Scenery approached the Government for the resumption of the dialogue process. Affected communities continue to demand an independent investigation, deeming it a prerequisite for the establishment of an impartial and effective resolution mechanism. On 6th November, the Executive Committee and the general membership of Malen Affected Land Owners Association (MALOA), expressed their dissatisfaction with the RSPO process and specifically the refusal of the SCS Global Services Audit Team to hold an open General Meeting at Sahn Malen Court Barray. The President made a solemn promise in 2018 to the hard-pressed aggrieved land owners and the people of the chiefdom, that he will resolve the festering land dispute between them and the palm oil producer.

There was a series of “red flags” available to OPIC regarding the economic status of charcoalers and the potential for the project to negatively affect them:In 2007, Environmental Scoping Report, reported that Earthcons identified local charcoal producers and other local inhabitants as groups that may be impacted by the clearance of entire farms or plantations. Earthcons recommended further study.

In August 2009: Vattenfall’s Corporate Social Responsibility Due Diligence Assessment: Liberia Wood Fuel Project described potential impacts on charcoalers. Impacts included reduced supply of wood, higher costs of production, displacement of charcoalers (possibly into the natural forest), and impaired community livelihoods.

 In November 2009, the ESIA for the BRF expansion project acknowledged that there was insufficient information on charcoal producers but stated that competition for wood could drive 30up the price of charcoal. In the ESIA section on stakeholder consultations, the FDA is quoted as expressing “fear” that this competition could cause charcoalers to turn to natural forest and wetlands for wood supply.

 During the late 2010, An OPIC internal document stated, “There is some probability that the project will be competing with the charcoal business for available wood.This may result in charcoal price increase which would disproportionately affect the poor. 
Thus charcoal producers may also venture further afield into the natural rainforest to obtain wood, which may adversely affect biodiversity. This risk was mitigated in the original project because the Company indicated that

BRF equipment left depressions that collected water, which bred mosquitoes disturbed drainage patterns and erosion have affected some houses.

Insects breeding in woodchip piles were a serious nuisance;  crops were damaged by road and camp construction and BRF did not pay compensation.Culverts damaged by trucks were not repaired and flooding occurs during the rainy season",,,Health|Education|Roads|Capacity building,"Buchanan shuttered its Liberian operations and dismissed 600 workers. It never built a promised power plant, so instead of powering a country in need, it shipped its biomass chips to Europe. It repaid the U.S. government loans.

Freeman Reserve residents told the OA that they had a number of unresolved complaints after BRF departed, BRF hired only one resident, so the community did not benefit from employment

It was also alleged that BRF made the farmers worse off by removing a steady source of income, not replacing it by means of cash crops or other assistance, and failing to provide positive developmental impact for the  farmers.

The OA finds that the allegation asserting that BRF worsened smallholders’ economic situation overstates causality and oversimplifies a socially and economically complex situation. Moreover, the allegation is weakened by the absence of written documentation that confirms verbal accounts. Nonetheless, the OA finds that some of the smallholders have lost at least a short-term income stream from contracting with BRF, without being given a means of income replacement. If BRF had continued its operations, these issues might have been addressed.",,,"In March 2012, the U.S. Embassy cabled OPIC questioning Buchanan’s business model and citing “tense exchanges” between the company and President Sirleaf. In May 2012, Swedish financiers withdrew from the enterprise. In November 2012, a former Buchanan human resources official sent OPIC a letter citing labor problems. In January 2013, Buchanan Renewables Fuel cancelled a remaining commitment of $28 million it could have borrowed from OPIC, sold its fuel and power group, and repaid its debt. Within months, the company that pledged to revive the economy dismissed 600 workers.
In January 2014, worker advocates filed a formal complaint to OPIC.

From the concession agreement: The project consists of the original Tongo Diamond Field Project mining lease, to which the area covered by the Panguma Exploration license was added. In May 2004, after successfully competing in a tender process for the rights to the Tongo Diamond Field exploration licence, Koidu Limited set out to accomplish the two major tasks proposed in their application, namely, to refurbish the road between Koidu and Tongo, and to undertake a bulk sampling programme on the dyke zones to verify historical grades. By September 2007, the Company had completed a large scale bulk sampling programme and a mining feasibility study which demonstrated that an economically viable dyke mining operation could be developed at Tongo, prompting the Company to submit an application for a mining lease. Koidu Limited received approval for a mining lease for the Tongo Diamond Field Project on 11 July 2008.

Among others, the Milky Way Partnership programme was scaled up through its participation in the public private DAMAU Household Milk Farm Project with Kaduna State Government with the aim of settling 1,000 farm households in a 9,000 hectare area by providing infrastructure and three imported cows for each farmer.

According to Witness Radio since 2017 when the evictions started, communities have complained about acts of violence meted against them by multinational companies from sexual and gender-based violence against women, defilement, torture, beating, kidnap to illegal arrest and detention among others.

In  february 2021 the Witness Radio reported that families that lost their land to multinationals and currently trapped in the middle of the plantations have begun a year with fresh attacks from allegedly their evictors.Batumbya Charles, 61, a resident of Kikungulu village, Kitwala parish in Kiryandongo district is the first victim of fresh violence since 2021 started. Batumbya, a father of 15, whose land is in the middle of the sugarcane plantations owned by Kiryandongo Sugar Limited was attacked from his home on a previous Sunday at 8:00 PM by two unidentified plain-clothed men who were armed with pangas and batons. The multinational companies is  also accused of  of intimidation and forcing them to receive as little as Uganda Shillings 150,000 equivalent to US Dollar 40 as compensation and when one refuses, such conduct is deemed disrespectful by investors and attracts serious beating.

NGOs including Witness Radio – Uganda, GRAIN, and Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa released a Kiryandongo report “landgrabs at gunpoint”, which exposed gross human rights violations and abuses committed by security agencies and 3 multinationals against communities. The motive for persecution is regarded as retaliation from district security agencies and multinational companies pinned in the report.Mandla’s Gwen talking  to Jeff Wokulira Sebagala of Witness Radio, Uganda, one of the organizations that recently authored the report “land grabs at gunpoint.” Jeff talks about the great diversity of people and their histories in this region and the sustainable local economies they have been powering, until now.

As the farm manager put it, “we tried to add a human face to whatever we did.” Over time, however, they had come to the decision that it made more sense to relocate settlers, for the following three reasons: settlers were stealing the fruit meant for export; the sanitation practices of settlers had implications for the quality of the fruit the companies were intending for export; the chemicals used to spray the crops could have an ill-effect on the health of the settlers. In an attempt to relocate the settlers in a just manner, the firm offered to help with relocation costs including offering to provide aluminium roofs to all the migrants who resettled in the village where the citizens who had leased them the lands lived. Due to a misunderstanding (settlers denied the fact that they had been offered relocation costs), the settlers opted to take the firm to court. Ultimately, they lost the court case because the judge who visited the site to confirm whether or their houses had indeed been destroyed, as they claimed, found no such thing. The company then rescinded their initial offer to roof the houses since they had spent the money earmarked for that on the court fees. Clearly, in this instance, information flow was very poor, leading the firm to spend money going to court and the settlers to spend money they barely had on a court case that they lost.",,,,,,,Health|Education|Other,"Engaged with local schools, scholarships for the children of staff, contributions to local clinics, boreholes.

The water is piped to the plant for gold washing. On the other side, Afrigold uses a reverse path across the river to dispose of the waste water. The level of this waste water is filled with mud and can reach a depth of two meters. And that becomes dangerous for people and animals. Some wild and domestic animals have perished in this muddy river as they try to reach the other side of the river. It took the youth of the village of Kolia to rise up for Afrigold to build a bridge to allow the villagers to cross.”

The people of Kolia accuse mining company AfriGold of being one of the biggest polluters of the Falémé. AfriGold’s head of administration, Bara Diallo, dodged the issue and explained: “We have not reached the cyanidation phase (a hydro-metallurgical technique for extracting gold using a solution of alkaline cyanides). Afrigold is in the expansion phase. We are not yet using chemicals. What we practice is a form of gold panning on a large scale. We use a gravitation system that only washes and grinds the ore.” 

And he added: “There is a system that allows us to transport the water. This water travels a long way to allow the heavy particles to settle in certain places. The water that goes back into the Falémé is actually clean water.”",,,,,,,,,No,,

The Société d’études et de réalisation des phosphates de Matam (SERPM) was granted an exploitation permit issued by a ministerial order on May 29, 2008, for a period of three years. This concession concerned the Southwest Lobe perimeter of Ndendory. For the exploitation of the deposit, the SERPM resorted to the services of the company Tracto Services Equipements, owned by the Senegalese businessman Cheick Amar who in May 2008 obtained 388 billion CFA francs investment (700 millions of dollars) from an anonymous consortium with US, Lebanese, Egyptian and Canadian capital (1). The production of natural phosphates increased from 20,000 tons in 2008 to 25,000 tons in 2009. SERPM and its partner Afcor built a modular granulator plant for the treatment of the phosphates. In 2012, a contractual dispute led Afcor to sue SERPM (2). Originally 51% owned by the Senegalese state, Cheick Amar gradually took control of the SERPM shares. This acquisition is opaque because there was no open tenders call, as required by Article 80 of the Code des Marches Publics (3). In 2011, a new exploitation concession was awarded to SERPM, on the perimeter of Ndiendouri-Ouali Diala, commonly known as the phosphates de Matam, in the department of Kanel, covering a total area of 661 km2. The concession has a validity of 25 years. The two deposits’ reserves of Ndiendouri and Ouali Diala are respectively estimated at 30 and 12 million tons. Annual production of fine phosphates is 1.5 million tons. SERPM became the Société minière de la Vallée du fleuve Sénégal (SOMIVA), in which the Senegalese state holds 10% of the capital.",No,,

It is estimated that six million tonnes of wood are annually transformed into 1.8million tons of charcoal from Bugoma forest at a cost ofshs40,000 ($ 11) a sack. Asimire Alice, a professional teacher and councilor for Kabwoya sub-county, says that the rate at which deforestation is taking place in Bugoma Forest worries the local community members, as they are complaining of the loss of natural herbs which they used to get from the special tree species in the forest.

Due to deforestation, there has been a direct loss of wildlife habitats. The removal of trees and other types of vegetation reduces available food, shelter, and breeding habitats. Wildlife is forced to migrate to survive and in doing so, end up in surrounding homes and gardens. This leads to increased human/wildlife conflict. According to WanaData (2021) there is also a high crime rate within the area, due to the increased number of people who were relocated from different areas of the country to help in cutting down trees, this has led to increased rape cases and defilement in the area.

Conservation groups and forestry experts have long warned that destroying even just a part of the forest’s diversity would lead to a loss of fauna and flora, and affect the water levels of the River Nile.“We consider this plan not only detrimental to the Ugandan government plans to develop and invest in tourism in Bugoma Forest, but to the overall fragile and rich ecosystem [which] will simply be irreparably compromised,” said Tessarin, who is also director of Uganda Jungle Lodges and owner of Bugoma Jungle Lodge.

Conservationists have launched a social media campaign, “Save Bugoma Forest”, and are petitioning President Yoweri Museveni to intervene.“It is necessary that the government of Uganda and the national institutions intervene to resolve a matter that cannot be just a legal battle in court and cannot be only about boundaries of proposed land titles,” said Tessarin.",,,Conservation,"It was considered a cultural site.

# Industrial Agriculture and Local Economic Growth: Evidence from Historical Satellite Imagery

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the findings from my
thesis, including all data ingestion and cleaning, generation of poverty
estimates, visualizations, and estimates.

The estimates of the household durable assets index were generated using model 
weights from [Yeh et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16185-w), 
and which Christopher Yeh generously makes available on [Github](https://github.com/chrisyeh96/africa_poverty_clean).
